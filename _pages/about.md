I am a Postdoctoral researcher at CEREGE (France), working in [Yannick Donnadieu](https://paleoclim-cnrs.github.io/team/yannick_donnadieu/){:target="\_blank"}'s team. Over the past few years I have studied the connections between geodynamics, geography and climate in the Maritime Continent and Indian ocean regions. My main tool to do so is paleoclimate modeling but I am also familiar with various numerical and geomorphology tools useful to study the Earth surface deformation. I try my best to make links among _things_ to better understand how the evolution of the geosphere connects with that of the climate system and the biosphere. Currently working (mostly) on Cretaceous ocean-continent interactions but my interests are varying with seasons !
