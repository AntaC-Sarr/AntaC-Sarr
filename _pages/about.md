I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at CEREGE (France), working with [Yannick Donnadieu](https://cerege-cl.github.io/team/yannick_donnadieu/){:target="\_blank"}. My research focuses on understanding the connections between geodynamics, geography and climate during the Cenozoic. I am using various numerical models as well as geomorphology tools in order to study vertical deformation, paleogeography and paleoclimate. I completed my Ph.D at Grenoble Alpes University.
