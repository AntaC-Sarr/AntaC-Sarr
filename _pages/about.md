I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher at CEREGE (France), working with [Yannick Donnadieu](https://paleoclim-cnrs.github.io/team/yannick_donnadieu/){:target="\_blank"}. Over the past few years I have studied the connections between geodynamics, geography and climate in the Maritime Continent and Indian ocean regions. My main tool to do so is paleoclimate modeling but I am also familiar with various numerical and geomorphology tools useful to study the Earth surface deformation. My main motivation is to try developping a transdisciplinary approach in research to understand how the evolution of geosphere connects with that of the climate system and the biosphere.
