I currently am a Postdoctoral fellow at ISTerre - Grenoble Alpes University (France). Over the past few years I have studied the connections between geodynamics, geography and climate in the Maritime Continent and Indian ocean regions. My main tool to do so is paleoclimate modeling but I am also familiar with various numerical and geomorphology tools useful to study the Earth surface deformation. I try my best to make links among _things_ to better understand how the evolution of the geosphere connects with that of the climate system and the biosphere. Currently working on Miocene evolution of seaway regions but my interests are varying with seasons !
