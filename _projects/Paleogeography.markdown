Over the past million years, evolution of paleogeography has been responsible for changes in the climate system. As gateways closed and opened, mountain belts grew and land-sea distribution evolved, winds and rainfall and oceanic currents have changed to shape the modern world. 

In this project initiated during my post-doc at CEREGE I use ocean-atmosphere and ocean biogeochemical models to explore how topography and land-sea mask distribution affect the climate system during the Cenozoic, with a specific focus on the Miocene.
