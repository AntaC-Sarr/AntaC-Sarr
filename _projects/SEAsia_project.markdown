Temporal variations of land-sea mask distribution, triggered by vertical deformation, may have first order implications on external spheres of the Earth (e.g. atmosphere, biodiversity). The physiography of the Maritime Continent, with myriads of islands and shallow sea enable rapid and efficient geography changes. This make it an ideal place to study such connections. During my PhD I use a combination of geomorphology and numerical modeling to explore the :

- Vertical deformation in Sundaland (West Indonesia) during the Quaternary
- Relation between geodynamics and vertical deformation
- Impact of geography changes on regional climate


Ongoing collaborations aim at investigating the impact of those mantle-driven physiographic changes on biogeography.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
```
